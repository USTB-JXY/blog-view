## 观后感
    1. 天才很少      
    2. 别在"山洞"里编程      
    3. 合理面对 code review      
    4. 不要害怕犯错，但不要在同样位置犯错        
    5. 和比自己厉害的人学习，参与进去他们的项目，慢慢提升自己        
总结： 不要试图成为天才 尽早并经常协作 成为"小鱼",离开舒适区        
> Summarizing:

    There is no genius
    Lose the ego
    Criticism is not evil
    Embrace failure
    Iterate Quickly
    Be a small fish
    Be influenced
    Be vulnerable
    Tools
    Involve collaborators early, but not too (at the 'sweet spot')

    In other words:

    Don't try to be a genius
    Collaborate early and often
    Pay attention to your tools
    Pay attention to timing
